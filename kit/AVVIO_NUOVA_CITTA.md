# Year Built: a new city with the kit (from 13/11/2026)

Prompt to paste at the start of a new chat:
> "Year Built: new city <CITY>. Use the kit (city3d repo, branch claude/inspiring-turing-oy4h6k, file kit/AVVIO_NUOVA_CITTA.md). Agents with explicit models (yb-scout haiku, yb-historian/yb-modeler/yb-qa sonnet), max 2-3 in parallel. The chat runs on Sonnet."

## Steps (★ = the owner's OK)
1. **yb-scout**: vidIQ search "<City> 3D timelapse" (5 credits) + open-data check (year per building).
   Saturation rule (12/11): best video under 5K = free; 5K–100K = go only with a clearly better product and a different angle; over 100K = proven demand, a test case.
2. **Data**: Spain → `fetch_es.py` (Catastro); Denmark → `fetch_dk.py`; Netherlands → `fetch_nl.py`. Other countries: see `kit/ATLANTE_DATI.md` (the source and download host may have to be unlocked).
3. **yb-historian** → `cities/<slug>/story.json` (sources, zones, walls, gutting, water/floods, monuments, ~45 cards, 25 soste, chapters, polities) + METADATA.md.
4. **yb-modeler** → monuments checked by eye.
5. `python -m kit build <slug>` and `python -m kit qa <slug> --render` (local, free) → **yb-qa** looks at contact.jpg.
6. `python -m kit pack <slug>` + commit/push.
7. ★ **Pod**: **A40** (5080s gave cuInit 999 on 12/11). Before cloning: `python3 -c "import ctypes;print(ctypes.CDLL('libcuda.so.1').cuInit(0))"` must print 0.
   `cd /workspace && git clone -b claude/inspiring-turing-oy4h6k https://github.com/doctail/city3d && cd city3d && PREVIEW_NIGHT=1 CITY=<slug> bash run.sh preview`
   Split the preview for the chat: `ffmpeg -i out/<slug>_preview.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -g 20 -an -f segment -segment_time 100 -reset_timestamps 1 out/prev_%d.mp4`
8. ★ Full render: `nohup env CITY=<slug> bash run.sh full > full.log 2>&1 &` (Valencia: about 2.5 h on the A40). Send only `out/years.json` to the chat.
9. Montaggio (local): years → `montaggio/years_<slug>.json`, `labels_cam.py`, `kit.eventi_kit`, `kit.labs_kit`, `kit_city.py`, `sfx_kit.py`, `ov_kit.sh <slug> long` (~1 h on CPU), cover with `thumb_city.py` (years in the TITLE → START → NOW).
10. ★ Final merge on the owner's PC (the ffmpeg command in `montaggio/monta_kit.bat`), upload, pinned comment, Reddit.

## Lessons from Valencia (12/11)
- `regia.duration` must match the music (two tracks = 511.5 s), or the video ends without music.
- Look at the preview before the full render: two previews caught 6 defects.
- Floods: `history.floods` (muddy water draped on the terrain) is restrained; a caption explains it.
- Use local names (Valencian, Catalan…) on monuments: viewers point it out.
